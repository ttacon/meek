meek

Meek is a MySQL introspection tool.

Obviously, your first question is probably "why not use innotop?" There's a
very good reason for this - innotop is painful to install and often breaks.
Don't get me wrong, innotop is an amazing tool - I've just personally had a
lot of trouble installing it and have found it to break on me (I'm no perl
wizard so that might also be why). So instead I started writing meek. Also,
you can have mee prompt you for a password instead of having to manually pass
one in.


Can I use meek?

Absolutely! Just be aware it's currently super alpha, a lot is very likely to
change. Having said that, feel free to file issues and contribute!
